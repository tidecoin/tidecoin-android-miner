 * This is a proof-of-work focused fork of yescrypt, including optimized and
 * cut-down implementation of the obsolete yescrypt 0.5 (based off its first
 * submission to PHC back in 2014) and a new proof-of-work specific variation
 * known as yespower 1.0.  The former is intended as an upgrade for
 * cryptocurrencies that already use yescrypt 0.5 and the latter may be used
 * as a further upgrade (hard fork) by those and other cryptocurrencies.  The
 * version of algorithm to use is requested through parameters, allowing for
 * both algorithms to co-exist in client and miner implementations (such as in
 * preparation for a hard-fork).
