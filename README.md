# Mining App

The foreground Service should run fine on most devices.
With the set settings, the device will start mining automatically even if the display is locked.
It is then sufficient, for example, to charge the smartphone at night and mining will start automatically when your settings are fulfilled.

The hash rate will be higher if the screen is unlocked and mining app is opened. The display is not locked automatically as long as the app is open.

From a battery temperature of 50Â°C there is a risk of irreversible damage of battery.
