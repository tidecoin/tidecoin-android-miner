# Manual

The Foreground Service should run fine on most devices.
With the set settings, the device will start mining automatically even if the display is locked.
It is then sufficient, for example, to charge the smartphone at night and mining will start automatically.


To be sure that the operating system does not interrupt the mining, the app can remain open. The display is not locked as long as the app is open.
