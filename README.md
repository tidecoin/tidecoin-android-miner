# Mining App

## Mining with opened app
The hash rate will be highest possible if the screen is unlocked and mining app is opened. The display is not locked automatically as long as the app stays opened.
From a battery temperature of more than 50Â°C there is a risk of irreversible damage of battery.  So please be careful with this setting.

To ensure the app has the rights, please check the following.
- Long press on the app icon. Select "App Info". "Battery usage" -> "Allow foreground activity".
- Also select: "Privacy Permissions (Allow Auto Start)"

## Mining with closed app
The foreground Service should run fine on most devices.
With the set settings, the device will start mining automatically even if the display is locked.
It is then sufficient, for example, to charge the smartphone at night and mining will start automatically when your settings are fulfilled.
(The app will only mine when the device is charging and the battery reaches a set level.)

To increase mining performance when device is locked, please check the following.
- Long press on the app icon. Select "App Info". "Battery usage" -> "Allow all background activity". (A warning will appear that the battery consumption will increase. That's correct. The app will only start mining when the specified properties are met.)
